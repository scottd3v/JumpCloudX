## What You Need to Know: JumpCloud Administrator Accounts

JumpCloud administrator accounts are **completely separate accounts** from JumpCloud user accounts.

JumpCloud administrator accounts are **not subject** to JumpCloud licensing and only provide access to the JumpCloud admin console.

To create, edit, or remove a JumpCloud administrator navigate to the settings by clicking the drop-down icon in the top right corner of the admin console and select 'Administrators'.

#### Troubleshooting Tips:

An email address can only be registered as a JumpCloud Administrator on a single JumpCloud instance.

  * If you receive an error that "the email address has already been registered" when trying to add a JumpCloud admin there are two paths to resolution:

    * Have the user log into the JumpCloud administrator portal with the email address that is throwing the error and update the email address of their JumpCloud admin user to a different email address. This will free up their email address to be reused.

    * Have the administrator [contact JumpCloud support](support@jumpcloud.com) **from the email address in question** and request an organization delete.

Because JumpCloud Administrator Accounts are different from JumpCloud User Accounts these accounts have specific password reset links which can be found on the [associated login page](https://console.jumpcloud.com/login).
