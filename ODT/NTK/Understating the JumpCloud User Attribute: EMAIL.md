## Understating the JumpCloud User Attribute: EMAIL

JumpCloud user receive account activation emails, password reset links, and log into the [JumpCloud User Portal](https://console.jumpcloud.com/login) with their JumpCloud email.

If you plan to integrate JumpCloud with a external directory integration like **G-Suite** or **Office 365**  the JumpCloud user email address **must align** with the users email address in the corresponding external directory in order for JumpCloud to be the password authority for the account.

  *  JumpCloud **does not** sync email aliases from directory integrations.

A JumpCloud user can only be configured with a **single email address**.
