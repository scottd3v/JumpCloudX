#### Answer

The JumpCloud Agent will rename the existing bill.fence account to billy.fence and takeover the account

####  Wrong!

If we refer back to [Understating the JumpCloud User Attribute: USERNAME
]() in order for the JumpCloud agent to takeover an account the USERNAME of the JumpCloud user bound to the machine must match identically with the USERNAME of the existing local system account for the account takeover to occur.

bill.fence != billy.Fence

The JumpCloud agent also does not have the ability to rename existing system user accounts!
